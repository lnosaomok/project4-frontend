### Frontend

The front end of the application is build mainly using react, coupled with compononts from Material UI and Materialize CSS.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material Design](https://materializecss.com/about.html)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)

### Backend

The back-end is based on a Mongo/Express/Node backend as well as the PubNub publisher/subscriber pattern where the app creates channels and listens for messages from the subscribed channel, immediately relaying back the information to the user.

The App also makes use of the EDAMAM API where majority of the recommended recipes were seeded from.

## Challenges/Issues

- Working with pages (View post and view recipes) that require data to be passed to them (show routes) and there is still a bug where the data props are list when user refreshes on a show route.
- Working with pubsub system for adding messages / reactions to messages. Currently new messages may be displayed multiple times although the server keeps a correct. User may have to refresh page to see correct count of messages.
